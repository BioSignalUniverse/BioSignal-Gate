# BioSignal Gate

BioSignal Gate is a modular, device-agnostic physiological signal processing and decision framework.

It is designed as a clean architecture system built around:

**Measure → Process → Decide → Execute**

The system runs in simulation mode by default and can integrate real wearable devices through optional sensor adapters.
